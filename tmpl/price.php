                            If you register after the birth, we
                            cannot guarantee you an appointment, as we are often well booked months in
                            advance.

<p>  As the name suggests, the shoot should
                            take place as soon as possible after the birth.
                            The ideal would be within the first 10
                            days.
                            Later I can no longer guarantee typical
                            newborn photos.
                            The babies are no longer so flexible and
                            can no longer be brought into the special poses.
                            In the case of fruit, the period is
                            somewhat more generous.</p>

No!!!
                            We have enough accessories!
                            Both for baby belly shootings and for
                            newborn shootings!
                            For baby belly shootings you should pack
                            underwear of the same color (1x white/1x black)!

                        <div  >
<p>
During our shootings it is very warm so
                            that your baby feels completely comfortable and can sleep soundly!
                            So wear something light so you don't
                            sweat!
                            For the family photos, I recommend simple
                            colors and clothes without prints and logos!
                            White, grey, beige, black,…
